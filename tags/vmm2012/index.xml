      <description>while using VMM 2012 R2 Preview Version in my LAB environment, i noticed that i was getting errors from one of the hosts that i was managing as a Hyper-V Host.
I found out that this issue is caused by having a SD Card in the system and VMM fails saying that it cannot communicate with my Host anymore. after removing SD Card, i was able to get VMM to work without any issues and my Hosts are responding back again.</description>
