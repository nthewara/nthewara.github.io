      <description>Microsoft announced yesterday that they will be making Windows 8.1 RTM / Windows Server 2012 RTM &amp;amp; Visual Studio 2013 RC made available for developer community based on feedback received. This was a slight deviation from previous communication when both products hit internal RTM milestone. however Iâ€™m extremely pleased for being able to obtain RTM bits for both Windows Client &amp;amp; Windows Server prior to GA milestone which is 18th October.</description>
