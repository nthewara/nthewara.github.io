      <description>In this blog post i will be discussing regarding an issue which i have faced recently on System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012 R2. In one of my recent projects, I had to setup two VMM 2012 R2 instances to configure Azure Site Recovery, for a Datacenter Failover simulation. While installing VMM 2012 R2, I noticed that my installation failed with a WinRM issue.
Quickly investigating this issue, I have checked my firewall settings and WinRM configuration</description>
