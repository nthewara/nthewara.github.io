      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; At the moment, we cannot create large disks or resize using the Azure Portal, and this needs to be done using an ARM template. Portal changes are planned to be rolled out within next few weeks along with the support for Azure backups and also Azure Site Recovery (Migration &amp;amp; DR). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Since the OS disks get created as a MBR drive, maximum supported for the OS disk is still limited at 2TB, however, Data disks can be attached up to 4TB of capacity.</description>
