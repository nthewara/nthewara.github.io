      <description>I was recently sent this error by a customer who was trying to backup their Operations Manager 2012 Data warehouse database.
 I did some initial troubleshooting and found out that the database was around 130GB in size and the destination didn’t have sufficient space for the backup. I tried with an alterative location with more storage space, and I was able to successfully backup the database.
I would also recommend looking at database grooming settings for Operations Manager data warehouse, as this database could be large in size with time.</description>
