      <description>Microsoft recently updated Azure Server Management tools with a new functionality, which allows remote execution of Windows updates against managed Windows Server / Nano Server instances using Azure Server Management tools. For those who are not familiar Azure Server management tools, I wrote a blog post recently announcing Azure Server Management Tools, which is a new method for managing Windows Server 2016 Servers and also Nano Servers. (https://nirmalt.com/2016/02/26/azure-server-management-toolsinstallation/)
Let’s have a look at the new patch management process using Server Management Tools.</description>

      <description>In this blog post let’s looks at creating a Storage Spaces Direct Hyper Converged solution using three virtual machines. For production deployment, it is recommended to use physical servers instead of virtual machines. I will be using Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5 version which was just released few days back for this blog post.
Before I move any further, I would like to highlight some of the key features introduced part of Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5</description>

      <description>A common question that gets raised around new Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview is around Why we should deploy Nano Server and what’s the benefit. In this blog post I will discuss few benefits when using Nano Server deployment Method.
Starting with Windows Server 2012, we had 3 deployment options
 Server Core Deployment Option MinShell Deployment Option Full Desktop Experience Deployment Option  Back then, for deployments such as Hyper-V it was recommended to deploy Server Core due to limited attack surface and reduced patches/hotfixes which we had to deploy.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, I provided an Introduction to Azure Server Management Tools. In this blog post we will look at installing &amp;amp; configuration Server Management Tools.
First Step involved in setting up Server Management Tools is for us to create a Server Management Tools Connection. Once a connection has been created, we can go ahead and provision Server Management Tools gateway. Gateway is an essential component which provides Azure Server Management Tools service, connectivity in to your on-premises or azure hosted Server 2016 VMs (At the moment support is only for Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview).</description>

      <description>Microsoft recently released Azure Server Management Tools preview for web-based management tools for Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview running on-premises as well as in Azure.
Currently, Server Management Tools offer the following capabilities:
 View and change system configuration View performance across various resources and manage processes and services Manage devices attached to the server View event logs View the list of installed roles and features Use a PowerShell console to manage and automate  Having server management tools available in Azure gives me the flexibility to manage my on-premises Windows Server 2016 servers and also Azure Windows Server 2016 Servers using a single portal.</description>

      <description>In this blog post we will look at how we can continue to use Windows Server Technical Preview and extend its expiry date till 1st OCT 2015.
At the moment when we login to Server Technical Preview before applying the hotfix, we get following message (I have another blog post earlier regarding this http://nirmalt.com/2015/04/04/this-build-of-windows-will-expire-soon-windows-server-technical-preview/)
Checking on Windows Version (winver)
Microsoft recently released a hotfix which will extend the time duration of Windows Server Technical Preview.</description>

      <description>UPDATE : Hotfix is now available and for more details please have a look at my blog http://nirmalt.com/2015/04/14/continue-to-use-windows-server-technical-preview-1-oct-2014
If you are running Windows Server Preview (Technical Preview 1 Released in 1stOct 2014), you might have already realized that it’s set to expire on 15thApril.
While Microsoft is preparing to release Technical Preview 2 sometime in May, we will need to look for an alternative to continue using Windows Server Preview build.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, we will look at configuring Cloud Witness, a new quorum option introduced in Windows Server vNext Technical Preview (OCT 2014 Release). Cloud witness was introduced as an option similar to a File Share Witness, but hosted on Azure without having to maintain any infrastructure within your datacenter. This allows us to have multi-site clusters without having the need to have a 3rd site as a witness.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, we will look at creating a Two Node File Server Cluster
Step 01 – Prepare your storage and Networks. In this demonstration I’m using Two Windows Server 2012 R2 Virtual Machines. I have two networks on each VM. One network for client communication and the other for cluster communication. I’m using iSCSI shared storage for this environment.
Step 02 – Next step would be for us to install Failover Cluster Features on both nodes.</description>

This was a slight deviation from previous communication when both products hit internal RTM milestone. however I’m extremely pleased for being able to obtain RTM bits for both Windows Client &amp;amp; Windows Server prior to GA milestone which is 18th October.</description>

      <description>In this post we will look at how we can add a disk resource to a cluster and also how to convert a disk in to a CSV (Cluster Shared Volume) storage.
first step is to have eligible storage available within the cluster. storage could be, any shared storage that you present to your cluster such as Serial Attached SCSI / Fiber Channel / iSCSI or even Shared VHDX. more information on Storage requirements please visit http://technet.</description>

      <description>After obtaining Windows Server 2012 R2 Preview, I thought of upgrading my lab environment. Upon completing Server 2012 R2 Preview upgrade, I noticed that there’s a Windows.old folder in my System drive which takes around 20GB of space.
now that I have already upgraded in to Server 2012 R2 Preview and confirmed that all my applications / file are available, I decided to delete Windows.old folder.
Best way to do this, is to use Disk Cleanup Tool.</description>

Lets first look at scalability improvements in Failover Clustering.
With Windows Server 2012 Failover Clustering, we can now scale up to 64 Nodes compared to 16 nodes which was possible on Windows Server 2008 R2.</description>
