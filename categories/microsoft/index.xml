      <description>Hybrid Use Benefit (HUB) Allows customers with Software Assurance to use their on-premises Windows Server licenses to license Servers in Azure. With one Windows Server license, you can run two Windows Server Virtual Machines up to 8 Cores or a single Virtual Machine up to 16 Cores. This is a significant price reduction for customers who are using standard Windows Server image from Azure Marketplace (Up to around 40% cost saving).</description>

      <description>I noticed that I’m unable to sign-in to Skype on my Windows 8 Release Preview version. I have tried to find a solution for this login issue and finally I discovered that we can delete shared.xml file and fix this issue.
first you need to make sure that Skype is not running, if its running you need to close it or end taskafter closing Skype navigate towards “%appdata%/Skype” and delete shared.</description>
